# Surfs_up Challenge

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to observe and analyze weather patterns across different months in the state of Hawaii to assist in the decision of investor, W.Avy to invest in a new business idea. The idea is the creation of a Surf and Shake shop to serve the locals and tourists of the island, Awahoo. The knowledge of this weather data will help in predicting the potential success (or failure) of going into this business venture to help determine if this is a good investment or not.

## Results & Summary
- The average temperature was higher for the month of June at 74.9 compared to that of December which was 71.0
- The minimum temperature observed for December was lower at 56.0 while the minimum for June was 64
- The maximum temperature was calculated to be 85 for the month of June which was higher than that of December at 83.

While there were differences in the average, minimum and maximum temperatures between the two months of June and December, the temperatures do not seem to vary drastically between the two months. Therefore it can be concluded creating the surf shop on the island of Awahoo would be a "safe" investment because the temperatures are relatively more stable across the different months of the year.
Some additional queries that could be performed to gather more weather data for June and December would be collecting data of the relative humidity and also the wind speed/direction of the island across the two months.
